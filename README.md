# Horror Light

This is a 3D Horror Game in which you play a character locked in a labyrinth.  
It is at the first person view.

The game is developped with Unity3D.  
To launch a WebGL build, you need **Firefox**.

This git contains the last version of my game with a descriptive document. It also contains the trailers of the game.
