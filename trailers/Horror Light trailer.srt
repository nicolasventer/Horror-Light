00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:01,999
HorrorLight.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,766
HorrorLight is a 3D horror game in which you play a character locked in a labyrinth.

3
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:09,066
It is at the first person view.

4
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:11,032
You can walk for the discretion …

5
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:13,133
Or you can run for your life,

6
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,233
Until you find the exit …

7
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:18,333
Or until you die!

8
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:22,499
There are 3 modes: Escape, Survivor and Infection.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,166
In escape mode, there are humans and monsters at the beginning.

10
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,999
In a given time, the humans are looking for an exit,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
Whereas the monsters are looking for the humans.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,666
Be careful, don’t team up with humans!

13
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:41,632
When a human go through an exit, this exit disappears and another is randomly placed.

14
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:46,466
And it can kill you! Or just makes you lose.

15
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:53,766
In survivor mode, there are humans at the beginning and monsters are appearing over time.

16
00:00:53,766 --> 00:01:00,766
The humans must survive the longest possible and find the most exits before dying.

17
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:03,732
Likewise, don’t team up with humans!

18
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:10,433
They will steal you exits and your score will stay low until you die!

19
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:15,499
In infection mode, there are more humans than monsters at the beginning.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,200
In a given time, the monsters must infect the most humans possible before they reach the exit.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,500
You can team up with humans: the more humans escaped, the less humans infected.

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,733
But be careful, if they are infected you can quickly be infected too.

23
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:43,933
All modes are playable in multiplayer and it’s highly recommended to play with friends.

24
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:50,066
You can use as a human or as a monster a lot of bonuses!

25
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:54,032
Rayon X vision, invisibility, minimap …

26
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,933
And you can place a lot of trap:

27
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:01,766
Blind mine, fake exit, immobilize mine…

28
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:04,632
Be the hunter or the hunted!

29
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:06,333
Choose your side!

30
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,699
Available in October 2017.
